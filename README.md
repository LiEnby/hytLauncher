#HytaleSP

An alternative launcher for "Hytale" with a fairly streightforward "native" UI
 features:
 
 - Multiple version management
 - Incremental patch from one version to another
 - Universal "online fix" or that works on all versions;
 - Access all "Supporter" and "Cursebreaker" cosmetic items.
 - Play local or online multiplayer
 - Completely standalone; a single executable- no butler or other external tools.
 - Fairly transparent online patch implementation.
 - Run offline and download without needing a hytale account.
 - Supports Windows 7+
 
Currently for: Windows and Linux (i would do MacOS, but i dont have access to an ARM Mac right now.)


NOTE: you can even probably play online, but only if the servers your joining have ``--auth-mode=insecure`` set in the command line;
enabling this option would also mean anyone using the offical launcher cannot play 
because it doesn't allow insecure auth type outside singleplayer offline mode; .. for some reason

also if you use the "online play" feature in singleplayer should also work as long as other users also use hytLauncher ...

## Project layout

hytServer.go - hytale authentication server emulator "online fix"

hytAuth.go - implementation of hytale OAuth2.0, currently not used

hytFormats.go - most of the JSON structures used by hytale are here;

hytClient.go - downloading versions, etc

patch.go - itch.io's 'apply patch' wharf code

jwt.go - JSON structures used in hytale auth tokens

locations.go - default / location resolvers for many folders


Aurora/ - c code for the dll or shared object, loaded with the game, 
that replaces account-data.hytale.com with a custom server .. 

# Building

on windows, you first have to build the "Aurora.dll" using MSVC, 
and then you can use ``go build .``
or you can ``build-windows.bat`` within the VS2026 developer command prompt to do this;

on linux, you need ``build-essential`` and then you can build "Aurora.so" using its Makefile;
after that you can use ``go build .`` 
or you can use ``build-linux.sh``

# Alternative names
Originally, i called it "hytLauncher", being a play on "TLauncher" for minecraft;
however i found that, alot of other alternative hytale launchers had a simular name, (eg HyTaLauncher, HyLauncher, etc.)

furthermore tLauncher is a bit sketchy in general and there are better options for minecraft too;
for now i have settled on "HytaleSP" .. a reference to an extremely OG minecraft launcher;

i may consider other names in the future;

other names i considered using :

- hyTLauncher
- HytaleSP
- AnjoCaidos Hytale Launcher
- HytaleForFree.com 

in all seriousness i kind of would want something a bit original xS
also this is not nessecarily planned to be a purely 'offline mode' launcher; 

i also want to add "premium" support as well-
mm the code for authentication flow is actually already here ..

but i wont remove the 'offline' or 'fakeonline' options for those who need them though ..
